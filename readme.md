#Coriolis Character Sheet

This is a character sheet for use on roll20.net for the upcoming English language release of the Coriolis RPG from Fira Ligan.

Ship sheets and roll macro buttons (for skill testing and weapon use) is expected to be added once the full game is released at the end of 2016.  But for now, this sheet should allow those with the English version of the Quickstart Guide to play the first released gameplay scenario.
